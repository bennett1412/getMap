Create a ReactJS app (MERN stack) to get the user to choose a location on a map (use Google Maps or Mapbox), display the region visible in the map and then on the click of a button, capture the visible region in the map as an image and apply it as a material (texture) to a 3D cuboid using BabylonJs.
